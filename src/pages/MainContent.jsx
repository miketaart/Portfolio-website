                <p>February 10th, 2020</p>
                <p>Five years ago I wrote my first line of code in college but never followed up with it up until half a year ago. With a great future ahead in Supply Chain Management I still felt unsatisfied with everything I was doing. In the meantime I got hooked on all the great stories of people who had enough courage to make a career switch into web development. I asked myself the question: “do you have what it takes to do the same?”. I quit my promising career and took the Ironhack web development bootcamp.</p>

                <p>Here I am, writing something about myself for my very own portfolio website. Check out my work and let the deeds speak for themselves. Welcome!</p>
